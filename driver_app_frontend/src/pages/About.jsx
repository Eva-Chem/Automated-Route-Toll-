      <h2>About Kenya Toll Collection</h2>

      <p>
        Kenya Toll Collection is a civic-tech initiative designed to simplify
        toll payments through geofencing and automated mobile payments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform detects when a vehicle enters a toll zone and enables
        seamless payment using M-Pesa, reducing congestion and improving
        compliance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to create a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly toll
        collection experience for motorists and authorities alike.
